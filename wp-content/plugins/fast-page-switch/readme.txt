Save time switching between posts of any post-type in wp-admin.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a metabox to the edit screen for any post type. The metabox lets you quickly switch between all available posts using the Select2 jQuery plugin. No need to visit "All Postsâ€œ first. You can use the settings page to determine for which post types (e.g. Pages, Posts, etc.) the metabox should be available.
